"P_ stands for probability and is used to represent the conditional probability of a certain outcome given a certain node in the decision tree. For example, P_GroupSustainer_Request represents the probability of a customer requesting to become a sustainer given that they are in the specific node represented by the code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Q_ stands for probability and is used to represent the probability of a certain outcome given a specific combination of nodes in the decision tree. For example, Q_GroupSustainer_Request represents the probability of a customer requesting to become a sustainer given the specific combination of nodes that they pass through in the decision tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"V_ stands for variable and is used to represent the relative importance of a particular variable in the decision tree. For example, V_GroupSustainer_Request represents the relative importance of the sustainer request variable in the decision tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
